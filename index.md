I’m an Assistant Professor of Quantitative Genetics and Genomics in the [Animal and Food Sciences Department](https://agriculture.okstate.edu/departments-programs/afs/) at Oklahoma State University. My research interests include quantitative genetics and precision livestock farming technologies for high-throughput phenotyping. My overarching research interest is understanding the genotype-phenotype map in livestock species using bioinformatics and statistical genetics. I’m interested in better understanding the genetic architecture of economically important traits and applying and developing statistical methods for prediction in the multi-omics era.
