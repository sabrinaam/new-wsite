I’m an Animal Scientist, MSc in Genetics and Animal Breeding, and currently a Ph.D. Student in the [School of Animal Sciences](https://sas.vt.edu/index.html) at Virginia Tech. My research interest includes quantitative genetics and image analyses of high-throughput phenotyping data. My overarching research interest is to understand the genotype-phenotype map in livestock species using bioinformatics, and statistical genetics. I’m interested in better understanding the genetic architecture of economically important traits and also applying and developing statistical methods for prediction in the multi-omics era.
