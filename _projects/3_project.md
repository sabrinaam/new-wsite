# High-throughput Phenotyping in Livestock


Sensing technologies are used in precision livestock farming to capture morphometric changes in animal growth and body composition dynamics. This cutting-edge technology boosts output while also assuring long-term viability and welfare. Computer vision technologies are critical for speeding up phenotyping efforts by providing non-intrusive structural assessments of animals with high temporal and spatial resolution. Our goal is to create computer vision systems that use depth sensor cameras to automatically estimate morphological changes in livestock species.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48261206/236860327-7687df42-467e-49cd-abc0-55740cfd5380.png)
