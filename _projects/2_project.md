# Improved MeSH analysis software tools for farm animals


The Medical Subject Headings, also known as MeSH, is a controlled life sciences vocabulary maintained by the National Library of Medicine to index journal articles. These headings are manually curated at the National Center for Biotechnology Information and used in the MEDLINE database accessible from PubMed. By mapping MeSH IDs to Entrez Gene IDs, MeSH turns into a powerful resource for enrichment analysis. In 2014, we developed MeSH annotation Bioconductor packages for over 80 species coupled with a MeSH enrichment analysis package that initially became available from Bioconductor 2.14 (April 2014). We reported the first detailed MeSH enrichment analysis of cattle, swine, horse, and chicken accompanied by reproducible R code to perform MeSH analysis.
